Firewall - a hardware or software security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules
Types of firewall:
1. Network-based - firewalls positioned between two or more networks, typically between the local area network (LAN) and the wide area network (WAN).
Their basic function is to control the flow of data between connected networks.
2. Host-based - firewalls deployed directly to the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources. This can be a daemon or service as a part of the operating system or an agent application for protection
